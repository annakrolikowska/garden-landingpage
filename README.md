# ðŸŒ» Garden Landing Page


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/10h0TV1/image-22.png'> 


 The landing page for a garden design website, built using HTML, CSS + Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The design was translated from a Figma project (originally created by adRespect). The landing page consists of several sections. The page features scroll-triggered animations that enhance the user experience while navigating through the content.

One of the notable features is the gallery section, where images are displayed in a responsive grid layout. Clicking on an image opens a popup, providing a closer look at the selected image. The entire website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
